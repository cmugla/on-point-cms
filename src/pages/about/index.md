### Brenda Glavin

Brenda is the founder and owner of OnPoint BIM and Drafting, LLC, and has over 15 years of technical drafting, modeling and management experience within various disciplines of the construction industry. Her experience includes electrical, structural, architectural, mechanical and plumbing modeling and drafting. Her formal education includes art, technical drafting, leadership, and software-specific training. Over the years, Brenda has built a formidable knowledge base around the craft of producing high-quality technical drawings, and the art of leading and inspiring the people around her to be successful.

Brenda has built a career around inspiration and high-quality work. Ask any of her peers who have worked closely with her, and you’ll know how much of herself she puts into her work. To Brenda, construction models and drawings truly are an art form, and she takes pride in every plan, rendering, and detail she touches. This attitude is infectious, and she has inspired many of those drafters and modelers in her charge to pursue the same level of passion in their work.
