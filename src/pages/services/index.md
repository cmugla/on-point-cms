## Design Modeling

Are you working on a Building Information Modeling (BIM) project and need a hand meeting a deadline? OnPoint can help. If it can be built, we can model it in Autodesk Revit® software, and we are extremely flexible in how we integrate our services into your workflow. Depending on your preferences, we can collaborate remotely using tools like Bluebeam Studio, or we can come to you and work directly with your design team using our own tools.

## BIM Model Compliance

Are you having trouble meeting an owner’s BIM requirements and unsure about what you need? We know how to read, interpret, and implement owner’s model compliance requirements and can help bring your deliverables up to speed. OnPoint can directly edit and update your content to comply, saving you the time and hassle of unnecessary resubmittals.
