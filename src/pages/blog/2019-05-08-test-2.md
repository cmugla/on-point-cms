Dear Mom,

Here’s your gas card. I’m sorry I stole it, I just put it in my pocket without thinking when we filled up on the way back from New York. I realized it when I got back to school, but figured that you didn’t have any use for it anymore (at least at home), and that it could wait until I got back.

I’ve also enclosed a check for $20.00 for Bink. I owed him this money from the last time I was on the island. I think that he’ll appreciate it. This, I also let slip my mind for a while. He’ll understand the real necessity of money when he becomes an esteemed college student. Or do artists not have to worry about such things?

I’m sorry I haven’t talked on the phone much, but I generally try to avoid the phone, don’t really like it much. And it’s expensive. It is nice to hear your voice, though.
